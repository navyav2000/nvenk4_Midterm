                            Albert Einstein: Known for developing the theory of relativity, Einstein is considered one of the most influential physicists of the 20th century. 
                            Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. 
                            Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. 
                            In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s degree.

                            During his stay at the Patent Office, and in his spare time, he produced much of his remarkable work and in 1908 he was appointed Privatdozent in Berne. 
                            In 1909 he became Professor Extraordinary at Zurich, in 1911 Professor of Theoretical Physics at Prague, returning to Zurich in the following year to fill a similar post. 
                            In 1914 he was appointed Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute and Professor in the University of Berlin. 
                            He became a German citizen in 1914 and remained in Berlin until 1933 when he renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America to take the position of Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton*. 
                            He became a United States citizen in 1940 and retired from his post in 1945.

                    "The Beauty of Simplicity in Science"
                    Science should strive for simplicity, not complexity. I have often found that nature's laws are elegant, straightforward. 
                    Take the theory of relativity—what seemed complicated could be distilled into a few key principles. Without imagination, we are only observers, not creators. 
                    Let your mind wander beyond the known!</a>

                    "Imagination Over Knowledge"
                    Imagination is more important than knowledge. 
                    Knowledge is finite, bound by what we already know. Imagination, on the other hand, opens up infinite possibilities for discovery. 
                    It is through imagination that I formulated the theory of relativity, daring to imagine what light itself.</a>

                    "On Peace and Humanity"
                    Peace is not merely the absence of war, but the presence of justice and empathy. 
                    We live in a world where technological advances outpace moral development. Science has given us great power, but it is up to humanity to wield it responsibly. 
                    If we lose sight of empathy and compassion, our greatest inventions.</a>

                    "Curiosity, The Heart of Inquiry"
                    I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious. Curiosity has led me down paths of discovery, even when others deemed my questions strange. 
                    It was curiosity that led me to question classical mechanics, to challenge the Newtonian view of the universe. Without asking questions, we remain stagnant.</a>
